# Custom React Hooks

This repository demonstrates how to create custom React hooks and render elements using a custom render function.

## Overview

Custom hooks in React allow you to extract and reuse stateful logic across multiple components. This repository includes an example of a custom render function that mimics the behavior of React's rendering process.

## Custom Render Function

The `customRender` function is designed to create and append DOM elements based on a given React element object.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. The custom render function will create and append an anchor element to the `#root` container.

## Conclusion

This example provides a basic understanding of how custom hooks and rendering logic can be implemented in React. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs.
