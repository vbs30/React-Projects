# Background Color Changer

This project demonstrates how to use the `useState` hook in React to change the background color of a component.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/p3-bg-changer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd p3-bg-changer
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Usage

1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn run dev
    ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### How It Works

This project uses the `useState` hook to manage the background color state. The state is initialized with a default color, and a function is created to toggle the background color between two values. This function is triggered by a button click, which updates the state and changes the background color of the component.
