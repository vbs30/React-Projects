## Overview

This app allows you to increase and decrease a counter by clicking buttons. It's a great way to get hands-on experience with React hooks and state management.

## What are Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

## Understanding `useState`

The `useState` hook is a special function that lets you add state to your functional components. When you call `useState`, it returns an array with two values:

1. The current state.
2. A function that lets you update the state.
