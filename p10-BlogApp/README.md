- Near-zero runtime errors in production thanks to proper error handling and validation.
- Enhanced security through proven authentication patterns.
- Faster load times and better SEO through optimized code practices.
- Simplified maintenance and updates due to modular architecture.
- Scalability ready - capable of handling increased user load without architectural changes.
- Reduced technical debt through proper coding patterns and documentation.
- Future-proof technology stack ensuring long-term viability.

## Core Functionality & Workflow ‚öôÔ∏è

### Authentication System
The platform implements a secure authentication flow through Appwrite:
- New users sign up by providing their name, email, and password
- Information is stored in Appwrite's auth section
- A unique userID is generated upon successful signup
- Login requires email and password
- Successful login redirects users to the home page

### Content Display and Management

Home Page:
- Displays only active posts
- Utilizes Appwrite's listDocuments method with specific query for active posts
- Accessible to all users (authenticated and non-authenticated)

All Posts Page:
- Shows both active and inactive posts
- Uses listDocuments method without query parameters
- Displays posts from all users

Create Posts Page:
- Allows users to add new posts with:
  - Title
  - Image upload
  - Active/Inactive status selection
  - Description (using TinyMCE editor)
- Forms implemented using React Hook Form
- Generates unique slug based on post title
- Associates posts with current user's userID

Post Management:
- Edit/Delete functionality available only to post owners
- Implements userID matching between userData and post's userID
- Other users cannot modify or delete posts they don't own

### Access Control
- Authentication check on every page
- Authenticated users: Access to all pages and functions
- Non-authenticated users: Limited to home page, signup, and login pages
